The Semantic Stack & DFH — Public Ground for AI

Creator of the Deterministic First-Hop (DFH) • Builder of the world’s first external semantic layer

👋 Welcome

This profile contains the entire open, public specification for the Semantic Stack — a simple, decentralized, domain-based semantic layer designed to give AI and search engines a deterministic starting point for meaning.

DFH is not a company, not a product, not a library.
It is a public standard — one that could have existed 20 years ago, and one that the internet has quietly been waiting for.

“DFH is DNS for meaning.”
A universal first-hop for every topic on the web.

🌐 What I Build
✔ The Semantic Stack

A minimal external layer that sits on top of the existing web, giving AI systems a reliable semantic ground.

✔ Deterministic First-Hop (DFH)

A single JSON-LD file at:

/.well-known/stack


…that defines:

type

entity

url

sitemap

canonical

This gives machines the one place to start before crawling anything else.

✔ Topic Roots & Sitemaps

Every domain can host its own semantic root.
Whoever owns the domain controls the ground for that topic.

This is the real missing semantic layer.

📚 Active Repositories
1. The-Semantic-Stack

The high-level concept, architecture, and reasoning behind the stack.

2. The-Semantic-Web-Stack-Deterministic-First-Hop-DFH-Public-Ground-For-AI

3. The-DFH-Semantic-Grounding-Installation-Guide

A complete “install DFH in minutes” guide for any domain owner.

4. Tools Root (Validators & Installers)

Practical tools that validate .well-known/stack files and help automate DFH publishing.

🧠 Why This Matters

The modern web has:

No canonical ground

No shared starting point

No decentralized semantic structure

And AI models hallucinate because the web is ambiguous, fragmented, and inconsistent

DFH fixes this with a single deterministic hop, defined externally, owned by nobody, implemented by anyone.

This is:

Simpler than any ontology

Smaller than any schema

More neutral than any corporate knowledge graph

A public grounding layer.

🗺 Vision

A world where:

Every topic has a clear, public root

AI systems resolve meaning deterministically

Developers and researchers have a stable semantic primitive

The web finally gets the layer it should have had since sitemaps were invented

DFH is not a replacement for search.
It’s the missing prerequisite for understanding.

🔓 License

Everything is MIT.
Free. Open. Forkable.
No lock-in. No gatekeepers.
Just the simplest possible semantic layer.

🤝 Want to Use DFH?

Pick a domain → publish one file → done.

Your topic becomes a deterministic root for AI and search forever.

⚡ Final Note

This profile exists to keep DFH:

Public

Neutral

Decentralized

Impossible to monopolize

The Semantic Stack is here.
The protocol is simple.
The land rush has already begun.
